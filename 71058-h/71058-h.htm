<p class="no-indent">“Edward! Edward!” cried little
Lewis Ashton; “when will you open
your sleepy eyes? Here I am almost
dressed, and you are not awake yet.
You forget we are not in London,
where nothing is to be seen but dull
streets and black looking houses; or
at school, where the first thing to be
heard in the morning, is the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
of the great bell calling us to lessons.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” cried Edward,
starting up as though the great bell
had really roused him from his slumbers:
“we are in Brighton at last;
in Brighton, where the king and
queen live, and where there are so
many grand things to be seen: but
what I want to see more than all is
the deep wide sea. It was so dark
when we came here last night, that
what papa told me was the sea looked
only, as we rode along, like a line
of black clouds.”</p>

<p>“Come to the window, then,” said
Lewis, “and you will see that it
looks bright and blue this morning.
How the waves sparkle in the sun-beams!
Those vessels in the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
must be fishing-boats, from
their size; or is it because they are
so very far away that they seem so
small?”</p>

<p>“Some are larger than others,”
said Edward: “and, look! it must
be a steam-vessel which is smoking
so, at the end of that long bridge we
see in the distance. Let us go and
ask papa to take us there; it wants
nearly an hour to breakfast-time
yet.”</p>

<p>Away ran both the children, Lewis
wondering much what the long bridge
he had seen from the window could
be intended for, as he saw no shore
at the further end—nothing but the
wide blue sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton told his little boys, he
should soon be ready to accompany<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
them; and Edward and Lewis amused
themselves, till he made his appearance,
in looking again at the new
scene before them, from the windows
of their sitting-room. Lewis soon
espied a strange-looking building,
different from any that he ever remembered
to have seen before. Edward
could only guess that it must
be the Pavilion which they saw, with
its domes and minarets. But now
papa’s voice was heard from the hall,
and the boys lost no time in obeying
the summons.</p>

<p>“Which way are we to walk?”
said Mr. Ashton, taking a hand of
each; “we must not be gone long,
your mamma says.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="facing005" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>The Chain Pier, Brighton.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Oh, papa, do take us to that
strange-looking bridge. Why did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>they build it there, running out into
the sea?”</p>

<p>Edward thought it might be for
the accommodation of passengers,
landing or embarking by the steam-vessels;
but he did not see any occasion
for its being of so great a
length.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton told them that the
Chain-pier (for such the building
was called) was used in the manner
Edward had supposed; but that it
was erected principally for the convenience
of the visitors and inhabitants
of Brighton, and that it forms one of
the most agreeable walks in the town;
“for, here” said he, as they passed
the noble esplanade which forms the
entrance to the pier, “we can enjoy
the pure sea-breezes, without the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
danger or difficulty of going out in an
open boat.”</p>

<p>When they reached the platform,
which is erected at the end of the
pier, Edward and Lewis were full of
wonder and delight. Papa pointed
out to them the fine view of Brighton,
and the line of coast on each side;
then the wide expanse of sea, and
the vessels, with their white sails
swelling in the breeze.</p>

<p>The pier that morning presented a
busy scene, with the passengers embarking
on board the steam-packet,
for Dieppe; and the little boys turned
reluctantly from the spot, when Mr.
Ashton warned them that it was
time they were on their way homeward.</p>

<p>“Dear papa,” said Edward, “will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
you be so good as to tell us who
planned this noble pier, and how
they could contrive to build it of
so great a length, and yet strong
enough to stand against the winds
and waves?”</p>

<p>“Wait one moment,” cried Lewis;
“I have not explored the lower part
of the pier yet. You <em>will</em> let us,
papa:” and the boys ran down the
steps, which descended to the platform
beneath that on which they
had been standing.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Ashton, as they
came panting up to him again, “what
is the result of your researches?
Edward looks as if he had something
very important to communicate.”</p>

<p>“We saw nothing but baths,
papa,” said Lewis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Edward, “I believe
I saw the piles on which this platform
stands.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” said his father;
“these piles are driven ten feet into
the solid rock, and they rise thirteen
feet above high-water mark. The four
iron towers which you see, are all
erected on platforms similarly raised:
the towers are each two hundred feet
apart. These suspension-chains are
of wrought-iron: they are firmly fixed
at the one end to the timber work of
the pier-head, and at the other, they
pass into tunnels formed in the cliff,
and are secured to an immense iron-plate.”</p>

<p>“This beautiful structure was
erected under the superintendence of
Captain Brown, a British naval officer:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the expense of the work was
thirty thousand pounds; and it was
completed in the short space of twelve
months.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Edward, “I should
hardly have thought, with all his
precautions, it would have withstood
such storms as I have heard uncle
Tom speak of, when the sea runs
mountains high, and breaks over the
tall masts of the ship, as though
it would be swallowed up every
instant. I am sure uncle Tom
will never make a sailor of me.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish he should, my boy,”
said Mr. Ashton; “yet you must do
your best to overcome your natural
timidity, or you will find it a source
of trouble and inconvenience to you in
passing through life. But to return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
to the pier. I do not wonder you
should doubt its strength, judging
from its light and elegant appearance;
and yet, I assure you, it is
better calculated to withstand the
force of the waves than buildings
of solid masonry, which present a
greater resistance to them. However,
I must honestly tell you, that
the chain-pier received considerable
injury only a few months back, in a
very heavy gale, which blew from
the south-west. Many of the caps
and chains were displaced, and the
planks torn up by the violence of
the wind, which seemed to set directly
against it.”</p>

<p>“Were you at Brighton then,
papa?”</p>

<p>“No; but I was once here during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
a much severer storm, when few
persons expected that a vestige of
this elegant structure would remain.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell us about it, papa!”
exclaimed both the children; and
Mr. Ashton, in compliance with their
entreaties, began:—</p>

<p>“It was on the 22nd of November,
1824, that Brighton was visited
with the awful tempest of which I
have been speaking. The night was
dark and gloomy, and the clouds
which swept across the sky, from time
to time, told of the coming storm.
Many hands were busily employed
in dragging the bathing-machines,
boats, &amp;c. from their usual places
on the beach to more sheltered situations;
while the inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
cottages, on the southern coast, looked
fearfully out, from time to time,
into the gloom which they tried in
vain to penetrate.</p>

<p>“The dreaded storm came at last;
and it seemed as though nothing
could escape its fury. Louder and
louder peals of thunder burst upon
the ear, while the livid glare of the
lightning only made the darkness
look more terrible.</p>

<p>“At length the day began to
dawn, and revealed a spectacle more
grand, yet awful, than you can
well imagine. The deafening roar
of winds and waters continued.
In looking seaward, nothing but
sheets of dazzling foam met the
eye; whilst the huge breakers,
now bursting on the shore, now dashing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
themselves against the cliffs,
seemed ready to swallow up all
that opposed them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the beautiful pier,” cried
Lewis, “what became of it then?”</p>

<p>“It was safe,” replied his papa;
“amid the contending elements, there
it stood, stretching out into the sea,
now almost hidden beneath the swelling
waters, now showing its graceful
form uninjured above the retiring
waves. Some of the outworks alone
were carried away; the pier itself
remained entire. But, my children,
I thought less at that moment of this
beautiful structure, than of such of
my fellow-creatures as were wanderers
on ocean’s troubled breast:
the thought of the hardships they
must have endured in that night of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
storms made me sad, whilst my heart
was raised in thankfulness to Him
who had cast my lot in scenes less
fraught with peril.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton would have told his
little boys, that under the protecting
providence of God we are alike safe,
whether on sea or land; but he was
interrupted by the rough voice of
a sailor who stood by them, and
seemed to forget, while listening to
the gentleman’s narration, that he
was in any other company than his
own.</p>

<p>“Ah! sure enough, they have reason
to be thankful to the end of their
days who got safe ashore. Yes, it was
in that very storm my poor Will was
lost, and Mary and the babies left to
struggle as they could: but they shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
never want a crust while old Tom
Price has one to share with them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton turned to look on the
speaker. Time and care had deeply
furrowed the cheeks of the old seaman,
and long exposure to hardships
had given a stern expression to his
features; but there was something
in his voice and manner which interested
his hearers.</p>

<p>“Do you live here? Shall you
ever go to sea again? Can you tell
us more about that terrible storm?”
with many other questions, were
asked by the children; nor did Mr.
Ashton take his leave until he had
learned the old seaman’s place of
abode, and promised, before very
long, to pay him a visit.</p>

<p>“And, now boys,” said he, “for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
a run: mamma will think us long in
coming; and if you are as hungry as
I am, you will not be sorry to sit
down to breakfast.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>


<p class="no-indent">Many days did not pass away before
Edward and Lewis had made themselves
pretty well acquainted with
the town of Brighton; its principal
streets, public buildings, squares,
esplanades, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton was obliged to leave
his family sooner than he had anticipated;
but the little boys ever found
a friend and companion in their affectionate
mother, ready to enter into
their plans, and assist them in any
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The children spent much of their
time out of doors, but sometimes
it happened, that their mamma was
not at liberty to accompany them;
or, worse than all, the weather would
not permit their leaving the house;
and there was then little passing in
the streets. At such times the question
was, “What shall we do to amuse
and employ ourselves? If we were
at home, we could look at some of
the large books of prints in the library,
or read some of our own, or play
with our historical or geographical
games.”</p>

<p>At last mamma thought of a
plan, and the boys agreed that it
would be a very good one. Edward
and Lewis were each provided with a
little book, in which they intended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
write an account of any thing that
interested them, during their stay at
Brighton, Mrs. Ashton promising to
assist them with any information in
her power; and thus they were furnished
with amusement and instruction
for many a leisure hour. Then
came the comparison of the memorandums
each had made.</p>

<p>Lewis found Edward had mentioned
many things that had never
entered his little giddy head; at any
rate, he seemed to think them not
worth remembering. Perhaps you
would have thought Lewis’s history
the most entertaining; but then there
were many blotted leaves, and sentences
left unfinished. Often, when
he was seated at the table, intending
to write very industriously, the sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
of a horn, or of a passing vehicle,
would draw him to the window; then
he must wait to see the passengers
mount, and the coach start: then a
gay party on horseback would pass,
or a pretty little chaise drawn by a
goat, till he found it very difficult to
recall his scattered thoughts; and
the memorandum-book stood a poor
chance of coming in for a share of
his attention. He really was sorry,
however, when he compared his brother’s
neatly written pages with his
own, and thought how much more
pleasure his papa would have in looking
at them.</p>

<p>“Edward,” said he, one day,
looking over his brother’s shoulder,
“where did you learn all this about
the early history of Brighton?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Edward confessed that he should
have known very little about it, if
his mamma had not assisted him, and
pointed out the accounts in some of
the books at the library.</p>

<p>Lewis looked half ashamed; for
he recollected that he had had the
same opportunity of gaining information.</p>

<p>“Now, Edward,” said he, drawing
his chair close to the table, “you
shall tell me all you can about it;
but I will not promise to write it all
in my manuscript book; only the
most entertaining things.”</p>

<p>Edward was pleased with the office
Lewis had chosen for him.</p>

<p>“First, then,” said he, “I must
tell you that Brighton, or more properly
Brighthelmstone, is of Saxon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
origin; for it is said, the Saxons invaded
it in the fifth century, and
afterwards settled here. It is said,
also, that it took its name from
Brighthelm, a Saxon chief, to whom
Ella, the invader, gave the place.
Many years afterwards it was possessed
by the family of Godwin, earl
of Kent, and from him it descended
to his son Harold.”</p>

<p>“Ah! poor king Harold,” said
Lewis, “I recollect he was killed in
the battle of Hastings, while he was
fighting against William the Conqueror.
I think I shall write something
about that famous battle.”</p>

<p>Edward thought it would be well
to do so, because the battle was
fought on that very coast, and because
Brighton changed masters in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
consequence; for William the Conqueror
gave all poor king Harold’s
possessions to his son-in-law, William
de Warren.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Edward said, “you
will not think it worth while to notice
the next thing my book mentions;
which is, that a charter for a weekly
market was obtained for the town of
Brighton, in 1313.”</p>

<p>Lewis thought it was a sign of its
being, even at so early a period, a
place of some consequence; and supposed
it had been getting larger and
richer ever since, until it had grown
into what they saw it.</p>

<p>Edward told him he was in a great
hurry to finish the story; but that
the thievish Danes had no mind for
letting Brighton alone so quietly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
whilst it remained open to their attacks,
and offered so fair a prospect
for their enriching themselves. After
the Danes, the French made frequent
warlike incursions on this line of
coast, plundering and shedding blood
wherever they appeared.</p>

<p>“But,” asked Lewis, “why did
not the people do something to keep
away these troublesome Frenchmen?
If they let them come quietly and
take away their property, I think
they were poor tame things, and did
not deserve much pity.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but you are mistaken there,”
said Edward: “though their king,
Edward III., was engaged in a war
in France, and had left his own country
undefended, the people here established
a protective guard of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
own: they were some of the bravest
men among the seamen and inhabitants,
and mounted on their fleet
horses, they were ready at a moment’s
call, when danger was apprehended.”</p>

<p>“Many years after this, during
the war between Henry VIII. and
Louis XII., the French appeared on
the coast, with the intention of burning
Brighton. Soon, however, the
beacons were lighted; and the people
seeing them, far and near, came
together in such numbers, that the
French thought it best to take themselves
off without putting their cruel
plan into execution. Queen Elizabeth
afterwards granted some money
to the town of Brighton, with which
land was purchased, and a building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
made to hold their stores and ammunition:
beside this, she ordered four
strong gates to be built, leading from
the cliff to the town beneath it, and
a high wall of flints, which extended
on both sides of the storehouse.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lewis, “I think
they were pretty well off then, and
had no need to fear the French, or
any other foes.”</p>

<p>Edward said he thought it was
much better to live in peaceable
days, such as they lived in, and to
have no foes to fear. “But see,
Lewis!” he exclaimed, “mamma
is coming across the Steyne, and
she has something in her hand: who
will be there first, to see what it can
be? Never mind the history now;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
you can have my book in the evening.”</p>

<p>Lewis soon forgot the history and
all belonging to it, and was at his
mother’s side.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Shells, Edward! bright polished
shells and sea-weed!” cried Lewis,
as he lifted the paper covering to a
small basket which his mamma held
in her hand; “where did you get
them? not on this barren coast, I
am sure; for Edward and I have
searched every where, and can find
nothing but common things, not worth
picking up.”</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>The Pavilion, Brighton.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“And yet, Lewis,” replied his
mother, “I assure you some of these
shells were found here; and I believe
you will see among them many of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>common ones you despise so much;
but the greater part were brought
from foreign countries. And the
beautiful little basket, that is something
new too. Yes, perhaps you
may hear the history of that another
time. I have been to old Price’s
dwelling, and have promised that
you shall pay him a visit this evening,
should the weather continue
fine. But, if I mistake not, you are
ready for a walk now:—the shells
will furnish us with in-door employment
some other time.”</p>

<p>The little party then turned their
steps towards the east cliff.</p>

<p>“How I do wish, mamma,” said
Lewis, when they had passed the
Pavilion, “I could see all that is to
be seen in that strange looking building!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
I should like to go over it, if
it were only for the pleasure of being
able to say, I had seen the place
where the king and queen of England
live.”</p>

<p>“Will it not do as well if I tell
you all I can about it; for I think
there is little chance of your gaining
admission to the palace.”</p>

<p>“Not quite so well, mamma; but
still it would be very entertaining:
and, perhaps, if I were to go to the
palace I might be disappointed in it;
as much disappointed as Edward and
I were in the king and queen. Do
you know, we expected to see them
dressed in velvet robes, and wearing
crowns on their heads; and after all,
we could not have told which were
their majesties, if papa had not pointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
them out to us: they were just
like any other people.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton smiled: she thought
the king and queen would be much
to be pitied, were they always obliged
to wear heavy crowns on their heads
and cumbersome dresses, such as Edward
and Lewis had imagined. But
she told Lewis, she did not think they
would be disappointed in the Pavilion,
could they obtain a sight of it, and
she would do her best to describe it.</p>

<p>Now, thought Lewis, this will be
much more entertaining to write in
my book than the early history of
Brighton, and Edward will know nothing
about it; for Edward had run
on before, and was at that moment
leaning on the railing at the edge of
the cliff, and looking down on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
gay parties that passed to and fro on
the chain-pier beneath.</p>

<p>This thought of Lewis’s, however,
was immediately succeeded by another,
and a better one, that in so
doing he should not be acting kindly
to his brother: so, loosing his arm
from his mother’s, he said, “I am
just going to call Edward;” and as
he ran along he said to himself, “I
am glad mamma did not think of it for
me; there is so much more pleasure
in doing what is right of one’s own
accord: and though Edward would
not have known I had prevented his
sharing the pleasure, I should have
blamed myself for it. I hardly know
which is the worst, to blame one’s
self, or be blamed by others: but
then it mostly happens, when papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
and mamma blame me, that I am
vexed with myself too.” Then Lewis
was going on to think, how he might,
much oftener than he did, avoid giving
himself this unnecessary pain; but
just then his brother set off to run
again; so Lewis shouted, “Edward!
Edward! Stop; pray stop!”</p>

<p>Edward turned, on hearing his
name called; and he was glad he
did so, though he wanted very much
to see the gentleman he had been
watching throw another stone into
the sea, for a beautiful Newfoundland
dog to bring out again.</p>

<p>“Look, Lewis! there they go along
the shore; now they have turned that
point we cannot see them, unless we
were to run further on.”</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Ashton came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
up. “You look warm,” said she,
“with your run: let us rest a little
while on one of these friendly seats.”</p>

<p>“Oh! mamma,” said Edward,
“how very, very beautiful the sea
looks this morning: but what can be
the reason that the colour of it is so
different in different places?”</p>

<p>“I believe,” said Mrs. Ashton,
“it is partly occasioned by the inequalities
in the surface of the earth
beneath the water, and partly by the
different colour of the soil: clouds
passing over it may also have some
effect upon it.”</p>

<p>Edward said, he had been thinking
a great deal of the different uses
of the sea, and still he thought there
must be some that had never occurred
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>“Well, now, Edward,” said Lewis,
who began to think he had waited
long and patiently enough, “I am
not going to be cheated out of my
story about the Pavilion: you know
we can <em>look</em> at the sea all the while
mamma is talking to us.” “And,”
added Mrs. Ashton, “Edward shall
explain what he means to me another
time; and perhaps I may be able
to make the matter clearer to him.”</p>

<p>“Now, dear mamma,” said Lewis,
“pray begin. Did you really go all
over the Pavilion yourself, or have
you only heard of its wonders from
other people?”</p>

<p>“I saw the interior of this oriental
building myself, Lewis, some years
ago, when I was on a visit here with
your uncle and aunt Brooks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Edward asked why his mother
called it oriental.</p>

<p>“Because,” she said, “it resembles
the palaces of the eastern princes.
Some say that it was modelled from
a design brought from China, by
lord Amherst.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Edward, “our old
friend, lord Amherst; he went to
Batavia, you know, for help for captain
Maxwell and his crew, after the
wreck of the Alceste, while all those
brave men were left on the little
island of Puloleat.”</p>

<p>His mother said she was glad he
remembered the story; and then
went on to describe her visit to the
Pavilion.</p>

<p>“We entered,” she said, “on the
western side, where the garden is situated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
and proceeded at once to a
magnificent apartment, called the
banquetting-room. I dare say you
have not forgotten the farm-house at
L——, where I told you I used to
live before I knew your papa; and,
when you recollect the plain old-fashioned,
but comfortable rooms I
had always been accustomed to there,
you will not be surprised to hear, that
my eyes were completely dazzled by
the many splendid objects that here
met their gaze. I could not tell
which to examine first. Our conductor
pointed out to us all that was
worthy of remark, and then directed
our attention to the dome above our
heads. It is thirty feet in diameter,
and eighty-five in height; the walls
of the room rising twenty feet, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
surmounted by an elegant cornice,
on which are raised four beautiful
arches, supported by golden columns;
above these, the dome rises still
higher, and represents an oriental
sky, partly hidden by the branching
foliage of a plantain-tree. From this
is suspended, by means of various
Chinese ornaments and symbols, a
superb lustre, in the form of a lotus;
which is a plant somewhat resembling
our water-lily, and is the Eastern
emblem of brightness and perfection.
This apartment is in the south
wing of the palace; in the north wing
is the music-room; but I do not recollect
any thing there that will particularly
interest you. Between the
banquetting and music rooms, in the
centre of the building, is the rotunda,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
or saloon: this is deemed the most
superb and elegantly furnished apartment
in the palace. It is of an oblong
form. A brilliant lustre is suspended
from the centre of the ceiling,
and others, of a smaller size, adorn
the entrances to the apartment at the
north and south. A beautiful chimney-piece
of statuary marble faces the
central window. The draperies were
of crimson and gold: ottomans and
chairs, covered with ruby-coloured
silk, and framed with gold, constituted
a part of the luxurious furniture.
The carpet was of light-blue,
beautifully wrought with Chinese subjects,
in gold colour. But I should
quite tire you were I to describe
every thing that dazzled and astonished
the eye in this abode of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
royalty; so I shall pass on to the
king’s bed-room, where there appeared
something more like quiet retired comfort.
Every thing in it was, as you will
suppose, well arranged. The dressing-room
adjoining it leads into a delightful
bath, into which hot and cold water
are conducted at pleasure. And
now, perhaps, it may amuse you to
hear something of the Chinese gallery;
though I fear I can hardly give
you an idea of its gorgeous splendour.
It is divided into five compartments,
the central one is illuminated by a
dome of tinted glass, and decorated
with a representation of the God of
Thunder, surrounded with his appropriate
emblems, as described in the
Chinese mythology. Corresponding
ornaments adorn the adjoining compartments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
which are partially separated
from each other, by trellis-work
of iron, in imitation of bamboo. The
staircases, at each extremity, are
lighted by horizontal skylights of
beautiful stained glass. On the ceiling
of one of the outer compartments,
is exhibited the <em>fum</em>, or Chinese
bird of royalty; on that of the
other, the imperial dragon.”</p>

<p>Here Lewis interrupted, to ask if
there really was such a bird as the
fum. His mother told him, that “the
Chinese are so singular a people,
and so fond of mystery, that less is
known of them or their country,
than of almost any other nation.
But travellers describe this bird as
really existing, and being one of exquisite
beauty, with a head much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
resembling the peacock’s. They say,
that it is found in no other part of
the world beside China, building its
nest in the mountains near Pekin;
and its absence for any considerable
time is looked upon as an omen of
misfortune to the royal family. The
Chinese consider the shoulders of the
fum an emblem of the virtues; their
wings signify justice, their sides obedience,
and their nest fidelity.”</p>

<p>“Well, dear mamma,” said Edward,
finding that his mother did
not proceed, “have you quite done
with the Pavilion?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton did not recollect anything
else that would be likely to interest
them: she was disappointed in
the library, which contained but few
books; the royal chapel, near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
south wing of the palace, she hoped
papa would be able to show them, on
his return to Brighton.</p>

<p>Edward and Lewis thanked her
for the treat in store for them, and
for the entertaining account she had
given them.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Mrs. Ashton,
“I am quite rested; and we must
not sit here any longer if we wish to
see Kemp-Town this morning.”</p>

<p>Edward asked why it was so called,
and was told that the buildings were
erected on the estate of a gentleman
of that name. They include a square
of great extent, opening from the
centre of a crescent, which is terminated
at each end by a wing; and
consist of elegant and commodious
private dwellings, all commanding a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
view of the Channel. The fronts of
the houses are adorned with Corinthian
columns and entablatures, and
surmounted with balustrades; and
before them is spread a fine lawn,
enclosed with cast-iron railings.
Many of the houses, however, were
uninhabited, which made Edward
and Lewis think the place had an
air of desolation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Mrs. Ashton, as
they turned to go homewards, “you
may like Kemp-Town better should
you live to see it some years hence.
Suppose now we return over the
Downs, in order to vary our walk.”</p>

<p>The boys joyfully assented, and
the party soon found themselves
above the dusty road, and out of the
immediate neighbourhood of houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Edward and Lewis were in high
spirits; sometimes they toppled each
other on the turf, or ran races together;
and, when tired of such active
games, they gathered the wild flowers
that grew on that chalky soil, or
turned to admire the wide-stretching
ocean which lay beneath, and to inhale
the fresh breeze which blew towards
the shore. Those who have
roamed the hills, with a clear blue
sky above them, and soft turf beneath
their feet, while the light breeze
played around them, will know something
of the pleasure which Edward
and Lewis felt during their walk over
the Downs, that bright summer morning.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The dwelling of old Price was not
what Edward and Lewis had at first
pictured to themselves a snug cottage
by the sea-shore, from whose latticed
windows, the dwellers might watch
the ever-varying face of the ocean,
or hail the first glimpse of the returning
fishing-vessel; but a small house
in one of the confined, back streets
of Brighton, so close and narrow,
that the children could almost fancy
themselves in London again.</p>

<p>The little party did not go empty-handed:
Edward carried a present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
for the old man, of a well filled tobacco-box,
on the lid of which was
represented a ship in a storm, with
the motto, “Such is Life.” Lewis
chose a book for the eldest boy,
who had learned to read pretty well
at the National School; and Mrs.
Ashton did not doubt, but the frock
which she had made for little Charley,
would give pleasure to the fond mother
as well as to the child.</p>

<p>The old seaman was sitting at the
low door, when his friends approached,
busily engaged in cutting a small
vessel from a block of wood, while
his little grandsons intently watched
the progress of the work.</p>

<p>He rose on perceiving his visitors,
uttering an exclamation of surprise
and pleasure; and then asked, if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
would be pleased to walk in, saying,
that though his berth was a poor one,
it was snug and clean; and he was
sure Mary would do her best to make
them welcome.</p>

<p>Mary now came forward, and seconded
her father’s invitation, which
was readily accepted.</p>

<p>Edward and Lewis were for making
friends at once with the children;
but the elder boy stood looking shyly
at the strangers, while the little one
ran to his mother, and hid his rosy
face in her apron.</p>

<p>The sight of the book, however,
soon caused them to become sociable:
little Tom could hardly believe it was
for him; and when once he had obtained
possession of it, he held it up
above his head, lest his brother, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
stood with extended hands, should
seize and tear it.</p>

<p>“Look here!” said Edward, as he
saw that the little fellow was half inclined
to cry, at being thus disappointed,
“here is a pretty picture for
you;” and he showed the box to the
child, and bade him ask grandfather
to let him fill his pipe with some of
the tobacco. “Tell him it is all for
him, and Charley shall give him some
when he wants it.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, how very kind this
is; you are too good to us,” said the
old man, as he lifted the little one on
his knee, and expressed his thanks in
the best manner he was able, to the
delighted donor.</p>

<p>The picture was admired and examined
again and again, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
sight of it seemed to revive some
painful recollections. The seaman remarked,
that the motto was a very
true one; and said that life had been
a stormy sea to him, though he had
met with many a friendly sail on the
voyage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton here expressed a hope,
that he might never be left without a
pilot, to whose safe guidance he could
trust; and reminded him, that all our
affairs are in the hands of Him, whose
voice the winds and waves obey.</p>

<p>The children saw that tears were
in the old man’s eyes, as he raised
them with a serious expression, and
said: “Yes, truly, Providence has
been to me like the bright pole-star,
when all around was dark. He will
not suffer those who trust in Him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
perish; so my Bible tells me, ma’am;
and I have found it to be, through
his blessing, a safe guide to port.”</p>

<p>“I rejoice to hear you say so,”
said Mrs. Ashton: “happy, indeed,
is the mariner, who trusts not in any
strength or skill of his own, to guide
his bark through the troubled ocean
of life.”</p>

<p>The widowed mother did not take
much part in this conversation; but
Edward and Lewis observed her fast-falling
tears, as she busily plyed her
needle. They therefore forbore to
ask any more questions about old
Tom’s voyages, the storms he had
encountered, or the foreign lands he
had visited, lest they should remind
poor Mary of the husband she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
lost, and give pain to her feeling
heart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton praised the neatness
and cleanliness of the little habitation;
and the children admired the
curious specimens of shells, fossils,
and sea-weed, which were arranged
on the top of an antique chest-of-drawers,
over which was placed a
looking-glass of the same date, so
inclined as to reflect the treasures
below, and draw the attention of
visitors to these marine productions.</p>

<p>A small shelf, near the fire-place,
contained a much-used Bible, and
some tracts, with two or three
other books. Mrs. Ashton added
a few to the little store; and then,
with many kind words, left the humble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
dwelling, amid the oft-repeated
thanks of poor Tom, and his daughter
Mary, for all the favours shown
them by the good lady, and the
young gentlemen.</p>

<p>Edward and Lewis were not sorry
when they had quitted the narrow,
confined street, to come in view of
the sea once more. They rambled
along the beach to the westward, enjoying
the cool sea-breezes, as they
had often done at other times.</p>

<p>The tide was now low, and many
women and children were employed
in shrimping, at a distance from the
shore; while the husbands and fathers
of some of them were busily
engaged in making the necessary repairs
in their fishing-nets, which were
spread all around to dry. The sun,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
like a vast globe of fire, seemed gradually
sinking below the horizon, until
it really appeared to rest upon the
ocean; and then the sky and water
were of the same golden hue.</p>

<p>Edward and Lewis looked again
and again, at the splendid sight, till
the sun had almost disappeared, and
only the bright tints remained. When
they joined their mother, who was
resting on one of the seats, they
found that she, too, had been watching
with delight the departure of the
glorious orb of day; nor did she fail
to remind her children, that such a
sight should inspire them with gratitude
to our beneficent Creator, who
“giveth us all things richly to enjoy;”
and whose power and goodness
are alike manifest in all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
works. “As you grow older,” she
said, “I hope you will find much
pleasure in examining them, and I
am sure that the more you do so, the
more you will admire the skill and
wisdom of the great Artificer. But
we have loitered here so long, my
dears, that we must not think of
going further to-night; some other
day we may, perhaps, pursue our
walk along the Cliff as far as Brunswick
Square.”</p>

<p>Evening, indeed, closed in upon
the little party before they had anticipated;
for by the time they reached
home, the last streak of golden light
had faded from the sky, and the stars,
one by one, began to twinkle in the
deep blue.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton saw, as she sat at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
window of her sitting-room, a sight
which she thought would greatly surprise
and delight the children; but
she waited awhile to see whether the
unusual appearance was noticed by
either of them.</p>

<p>Presently Edward looked up from
his supper, which he was eating with
a keen relish after their evenings
ramble, and exclaimed, in a voice of
astonishment and almost of alarm,
“Mamma! Lewis! look! the sea is
all on fire!”</p>

<p>Lewis’s wonder was as great as his
brothers: “What could it be?”</p>

<p>Edward’s fear subsided when he
had looked for a few moments on
the beautiful scene; at last he said,
“Dear mamma, can there be any
animals in the sea that give light in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the dark, as the glow-worm does on
land?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton was pleased that her
little boy tried to find out for himself
the reason of any thing which he did
not quite understand; and she asked,
whether either of the children recollected
to have seen, when the sea was
clear, animals of a jelly-like substance,
many of them with long tentaculæ,
or arms, which they kept waving
in all directions.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lewis, “we have seen
them. One of the boatmen told us
they were called falling-stars.”</p>

<p>“True, many of them are marked
with a cross or star, and they reflect
the sun’s rays in a beautiful manner.
These jelly-fish, or more properly
Medusæ, are, with many other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
marine animals, luminous in the dark,
and look, as you have seen, like so
many thousands of sparkling gems.
There is one little animal of this
kind, of which I recollect reading a
very interesting account. It is called,
the purple-ocean or blue snail-shell;
and is plentifully supplied with a
juice which is very luminous in the
dark.”</p>

<p>“Oh! mamma,” said Edward, “do
you think if we go down to the beach
to-morrow morning, there will be a
chance of our finding any?”</p>

<p>“No, my dear, this little wanderer
of the deep never approaches the
shore unless it be accidentally. Unlike
many other small shell-fish,
which attach themselves to rocks, it
is furnished with a house that is extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
thin and light, and I think it
will amuse you to hear of the curious
contrivance, by which it is enabled
either to remain on the surface of the
water or descend below it. It is endowed
with the wonderful power of
raising at will a tiny bag inflated with
air, by means of which it floats; but,
when to descend is the object, it is
lowered or cast off, and the little
animal disappears. They are often
seen by voyagers floating together in
great numbers, many hundred miles
from land.”</p>

<p>“How surprising!” said Edward,
“and how beautiful they must look,
either by night or day! But I need
not wish to go abroad for the sake of
the purple-ocean snail-shell, when I
can see so grand a sight at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton told Edward it was
wise to endeavour to be contented
with our situation, whatever it may
be, and not to spoil our enjoyment
of the pleasures within our reach,
by wishing for those which we cannot
attain; but, she added, we must
not forget the obligations we are
under to those adventurous spirits,
who delight to brave dangers in
search of what is new and curious;
while we, who remain quietly at
home, reap the fruits of their labours
and experience.</p>

<p>Lewis thought there must be quite
as much pleasure in travelling as
would compensate for the danger and
toil: “So, Edward,” he said, “when
I am a man and a traveller, I will
send you home specimens of birds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
beasts, and fishes; and you may
class and arrange them all to your
heart’s content; for that is dull work,
if you please.”</p>

<p>Here their mother warned them
that it was long past the usual time
for their retiring to rest.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Edward, “may
I ask you one thing before we go?
Will you let me hear those lines you
were repeating to papa the other
day; there was something about
striking the waves with an oar, and
the cold flame flashing along the
hand, which I could not at all understand:
but now, I think I know
what it meant.”</p>

<p>“I will repeat them with pleasure,
my love,” said his mother, “they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
describe the very scene which has
delighted you so much:—</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Good news! great news! Lewis,”
cried Edward, the moment his brother
entered the breakfast-room the next
morning. “If you had been up a
little sooner you might have heard it
too. Now guess who is coming to-day.”</p>

<p>Lewis raised a shout of joy, and
exclaimed, that it must be his dear
papa.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are partly right; but
there is some one else coming too,”
said Edward, his eyes sparkling with
pleasure: “cannot you guess?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“Not I,” said Lewis; “I am
afraid, if papa has any of his friends
with him, he will not give up so much
of his time to us.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but it is a friend of ours too,
Lewis, I must tell you. Papa is
going to bring cousin Helen with
him; and she is to stay till we return
to school.”</p>

<p>“Oh, joy! joy!” cried Lewis,
“how many things we shall have to
show her and tell her about! How
soon will they be here?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton said, she did not expect
the travellers till evening; and
advised the children to form some
plan of employment for the day, that
the time might not pass heavily.</p>

<p>“Will you help us, mamma?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
said Edward; “I always like your
plans.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said his mother,
“suppose we walk this morning, and
spend the afternoon in looking at,
and arranging the shells and sea-weed:
perhaps,” she added, seeing
Lewis’s look of disappointment, “I
may find something entertaining to
tell you respecting them; and you,
Lewis, may choose our walk for this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mamma; then, if
you please, we will go along the
western cliff, as far as Brunswick
Square. I like that side of the town,
it is so gay; besides, I see by the
little map papa gave us, that there
are several squares in that direction;
and I want to visit them all, that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
may make a good showman for cousin
Helen.”</p>

<p>“I am sure Helen will be much
obliged to you,” said his mother;
“but I am afraid you have undertaken
more than can be accomplished
in one morning, by such pedestrians
as we. What say you to a ride?”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you! thank you! that
<em>will</em> be pleasant!” exclaimed the
children; and in a few minutes they
were seated by their mother, in one
of the convenient little open carriages
which are always to be met with in
Brighton; Mrs. Ashton having told
the driver that they wished to visit
the Chalybeate.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Edward, as he
sprung from the carriage, “I do not
think I have seen any thing so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
pretty as this little rustic cottage,
surrounded with trees, since we have
been at Brighton; it looks so cool
and shady. But why, mamma, did
you call it the Chalybeate?”</p>

<p>“Because, my dear, there is here
a chalybeate, or mineral spring, which
has been found to possess valuable
medicinal properties: you shall taste
the water if you please.”</p>

<p>Edward and Lewis did so: it was
very cold, but they thought it extremely
unpleasant, and had no wish
to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p>Their mother told them, that the
spring had been found to contain
muriate of soda, muriate of magnesia,
sulphate of lime, oxide of iron, and
silicia, or flint.</p>

<p>When the children had seen as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
much as they wished of the chalybeate
spring, the reading-room, cottage,
&amp;c., Lewis took from his pocket
the little map of Brighton, and showed
his mother that Brunswick Square
might be visited on their road home.
“But see, mamma,” he added, “here
is Adelaide Crescent; will it tire you
too much to go there? it is not much
out of the way. But what is this circular
mark in the map intended for,
with the word ‘Dome’ by it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton told them, that in that
spot was situated the Antheum, or
Oriental Garden; but that the stupendous
dome, she regretted to say,
was no longer there: it fell in with a
tremendous crash only a few days
after its completion. Happily, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
disastrous event took place in the
night, so that no lives were lost.</p>

<p>This building, which was the largest
of the kind ever erected, was intended
as a conservatory, for the reception
and preservation of the rare and beautiful
plants of tropical climates; the
interior was very tastefully arranged,
and contained a basin for aquatic
plants. The dome represented the
inverted calyx of an open flower,
and was one hundred and two feet
larger than that of the Cathedral of
St. Peter’s at Rome.</p>

<p>Edward and Lewis, mourned over
the fate of the poor conservatory, and
pitied the gentleman who had projected
it; at the same time hoping,
that he, or some one else, would
have spirit enough to recommence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
undertaking; till fresh objects of interest
arrested their attention.</p>

<p>They both agreed in thinking Adelaide
Crescent would be very beautiful
when completed, and in admiring
the splendid houses, comprising
Brunswick Square and Terrace: Regency
Square, and Bedford Square,
with the noble Hotel, bearing the
same name, the children had before
seen.</p>

<p>“Edward,” said Mrs. Ashton, as
they passed the end of West Street,
“you are fond of history; and it will,
perhaps, interest you to hear that
near this spot is still standing the
inn which afforded a temporary shelter
to the unfortunate king Charles II.,
after the battle of Worcester, when
he fled from his rebel-subjects to the
continent. His faithful friends, colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Gunton and lord Wilmot, had
laid a plan for his escape, in which
they were aided by a man, named
Tattersal, the master of a coal-brig,
who promised to conduct king Charles
in safety across the Channel. Accordingly,
he was brought in disguise
over the hills to Brighton, to await
the sailing of the vessel; but greatly
to the alarm of all parties concerned,
the owner of the inn immediately recognized
his royal guest. Smith, for
that was his name, would not, however,
betray his sovereign: notwithstanding
the enormous sum offered
for his capture, he kept his secret
inviolable; and, at five in the morning,
Charles embarked with a favourable
wind, and landed the next day
at Fescamp in Normandy.”</p>

<p>“That was nobly done,” said Edward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
“I hope, when king Charles
was restored to his country and kingdom,
he did not forget those who had
befriended him in his misfortunes.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said Mrs. Ashton,
“how it fared with the innkeeper;
but Nicholas Tattersal’s fidelity
was rewarded by an annuity of
one hundred pounds being settled
on himself and heirs. Some of Tattersal’s
descendants are yet living in
the town; but the pension has been,
from what cause I know not, discontinued.”</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Lewis, as they
again drew near home, “can you
tell me how far it is from Kemp-Town
to Brunswick Terrace? for I
suppose that takes in the whole of
Brighton, from east to west.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said his mother, “the distance
is not less than two miles and
a half; and from our present place
of residence, the Steyne, to the extremity
of the parish, on the London
road, is about one mile and a quarter.
Formerly, East Street, West
Street, and North Street were boundaries
of the town, so you may judge
how greatly it is increased. But,
Lewis, the clock has struck two, and
we must lose no time in preparing
for dinner.”</p>

<p>“Two o’clock!” said Edward;
“only four more hours to wait, and
then papa and Helen will be here.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“I wonder,” said Lewis, as the
basket of shells and sea-weed was
placed on the table, “what can be
the use of the hard names people always
give to their shells. I think it
would be much better to call them by
some name which should describe
the shell, and which every body could
understand.”</p>

<p>“And in saying this, Lewis,” said
Mrs. Ashton, “you have furnished
an argument in favour of systems
and classifications.”</p>

<p>“How so, mamma? When you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
spoke to us the other day of the little
purple-ocean snail-shell, I formed a
much better idea of it than if you had
called it by some Latin name, which
I could not understand.”</p>

<p>“And yet, my dear, if you had
wished to find this shell, and place it
among your collection, the name by
which I called it would have been of
little assistance to you; for there are
other small purple shells, which you
might very likely have mistaken for
the one in question: and, perhaps,
the first person you asked about it,
would have told you it was something
quite different. Had you been
in a foreign land, the English name
would have been useless; and, indeed,
even in various parts of our
own country, things are called by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
very different names. The object is
to find an appellation for it, and other
shells, which shall be common to all
naturalists; and thus assist you, by
reference to their works, to discover
every thing that is known respecting
them. The shell we have been speaking
of, is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">helix janthina</i>; and
when once you are acquainted with
this, its Linnæan name, you may
readily find, in books on conchology,
such a description of it as would
prevent your mistaking any other
for it. I believe you already know
the three great divisions into which
shells are arranged, of <em>univalves</em>,
<em>bivalves</em>, and <em>multivalves</em>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mamma,” said Lewis, taking
up a common whelk, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buccinum</i>,)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
“this belongs to the first division;
it has only one piece.”</p>

<p>“And this muscle,” said Edward,
“is a <em>bivalve</em>. I do not see a <em>multivalve</em>
in this collection.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton soon found one.</p>

<p>“Now, mamma,” said Lewis, “before
you tell us the name, will you
show me how to set about finding it
for myself?”</p>

<p>“Willingly,” said Mrs. Ashton;
“it is always pleasant to help those
who try to help themselves: but in
this instance perhaps Edward will
lend his assistance; and I shall then
have the additional satisfaction of
knowing that he does not forget
what he has once learned.”</p>

<p>“Mamma taught me,” said Edward,
“that there are but three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
classes in the <em>multivalve</em> division of
shells; and this you see must belong
to one of them, for it has many
pieces. Now, Lewis, I will read to
you what my text-book says about
them; and you shall see which description
answers best to the shell
we have been looking at. First, the
<em>chiton</em>, canoe or boat-shell, consisting
of several segments, placed transversely,
and lying upon each other
at their anterior edge.”</p>

<p>Lewis put on a considering face,
and again examined the shell.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” said he, “segment—that
means part of a circle, placed
transversely—cross-ways, and lying
one over the other. I see nothing of
the kind: besides, this is not at all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
in the shape of a boat or canoe, so it
cannot be a <em>chiton</em>.”</p>

<p>“Will you go on to the next class,
if you please?”</p>

<p>“I have not finished the account,”
said Edward; “but, since you are so
well satisfied, we will try the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas</i>,
or barnacle.”</p>

<p>Edward reads:—“Shell affixed at
the base; and consisting of many
unequal erect valves.”</p>

<p>“That will do, so far,” said Lewis,
as Edward waited to see the result of
his further examination. “I dare
say this is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas</i>. But, oh! mamma,”
he cried, changing his tone,
“there are three or four orders in
this class. How shall we fix on the
right one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“By attention to the description,”
said his mother; “and at the end of
the book here are plates, which, perhaps,
will help you.”</p>

<p>Lewis turned to the plates; and
with the assistance of them, and the
description given, he came at last to
the conclusion, that the shell in question
must be the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas anatifera</i>.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Mrs. Ashton,
“you have been very persevering,
and I will endeavour to tell you
something interesting respecting the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas</i>. These extraordinary shell-fish
are never found detached from other
substances: they adhere firmly to
rocks and stones, and even to larger
fish, such as the whale. The numbers
which sometimes attach themselves
to the sides of vessels, add so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
greatly to their weight as to impede
their progress; so that, you see, the
inhabitant of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas</i> is frequently
a traveller, and is exposed to the violence
of the boisterous waves. Now,
observe how admirably the Creator
has provided for this little creature’s
safety: here, at the entrance of its
shell, is fixed a door, consisting of
triangular valves, which the lepas
opens or shuts as may best suit his
convenience; by means of this little
feathery tube the animal procures
its food. I will read to you an anecdote,
whilst we are upon the present
subject, which I copied the other
day from Mr. Roberts’s Conchologist’s
Companion:—</p>

<p>“‘The mention of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas</i> is connected
with an extraordinary fact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
occurred some years since at Sidmouth.
A small coasting-vessel, with
a few hands on board, sprung a leak,
and went down within sight of several
persons on the Esplanade. It was
a melancholy circumstance, and as
such, excited much commiseration;
but time passed on and the occurrence
was forgotten, till one morning
the vessel gradually arose from out
of the water, and was driven by the
tide upon the shore. The beach was
soon covered with spectators; and
on inspection, the sides, the deck,
the remains of the mast, in short,
every part was seen bristling with
barnacles. The meal-tub especially
was so covered with them as to present
a beautiful and novel appearance.
The reason of the vessel’s reappearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
was now obvious; the long
tubes of the barnacles, being full of
air, had rendered the sunken vessel
specifically lighter than the water;
and she arose from off her watery
bed after the lapse of nearly twenty
years.’ The author adds: ‘The person
from whom I heard this curious
incident, was one of the spectators:
he had preserved some remarkably
fine specimens. It is a fact that may
possibly suggest some mode of rendering
vessels so buoyant as not to
sink in even the most tremendous
storms.’”</p>

<p>Edward and Lewis were much delighted
with the account their mother
gave them of the barnacle, and of
the surprising reappearance of the
sunken vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Lewis, “I believe
I shall always know the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas</i>, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lepas anatifera</i> I mean, when I see
it again. Do you think you could
get for us any specimens of the
other orders belonging to this class?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton promised to do so if
possible.</p>

<p>“Lewis,” she said, “I think you
will not call conchology so very
dry a subject another time, if I may
judge from the interest you have
taken in it: but perhaps you have
learned enough of classification for
to-day.”</p>

<p>The children begged to be allowed
to look at the shells a little longer;
and again and again admired their
bright colours and elegant forms.</p>

<p>“The most beautiful shells,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
Mrs. Ashton, “are brought from
the Red Sea and the East Indies.
Those which are found in the West
Indies are less brilliant; and the
shells of colder regions possess still
less lustre and variety of colours:
so that this difference may very reasonably
be attributed, in some measure,
to solar heat: perhaps, too,
those seas in which the most brilliant
shells are found, may furnish a
greater supply of nourishment to the
animals which inhabit them, and
thus cause their shelly coverings to
increase in size and beauty.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean, mamma,”
said Edward, “that shells grow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear: naturalists tell us,
that an infant shell-fish is covered
with a testaceous coating, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
gradually increased by the supply of
a viscous substance, exuding from
the animal, until it is furnished with
a dwelling completely adapted to its
wants and situation. It is very interesting
to notice the great variety
of habitations provided for the different
species, and to see how admirably
each one is in accordance
with the instincts of the occupant.
Some are sheltered by thick coverings,
which protect them from the
beating of the boisterous waves;
others, which inhabit the still waters
of ponds or ditches, have light and
fragile dwellings. The shells of
some animals are in form like little
vessels, the valves of which they open
to the breeze, and thus float on the
surface of the waves; others, inclosed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
in cases, which remind us of
the diving-bell, lie hid in ocean’s
caves; or occasionally descend to
the very bottom of the sea. The
limpet, in his conical dwelling, lives
like a solitary hermit on the sea-coast:
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinna</i> has a shell so large
as to admit other guests: the <em>chiton</em>
rolls himself up in the plaited folds
of his armour, at the first approach
of danger; while other fish, apparently
more defenceless, have shells
of such a form as to enable them to
make a speedy retreat from their
enemies.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Lewis wanted much to know what
the armour of the <em>chiton</em> was; but
just as he was going to make the inquiry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the sound of a horn attracted
the attention of the little party.</p>

<p>“Can it be six o’clock already?”
cried he.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed,” said Edward, “and
there is dear papa on the coach; and
cousin Helen is showing her face at
the window.”</p>

<p>But a few moments passed, and
the happy children were at their
father’s side.</p>

<p>“Well, cousin Helen,” exclaimed
Lewis, when the first greetings
were over, “how you are grown!
you are almost as tall as Edward, I
do believe. I hope you are not too
much of a woman to play with boys
now; though you have been to boarding-school
since we saw you. Is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Brighton a delightful place? Were
you not very glad to come?”</p>

<p>“Poor Helen!” said Mr. Ashton,
“you will not give her time to answer
one question, before you put another.”
Helen’s merry face showed that she
was not very sorry about <em>any thing</em>
just now.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” she said, “papa
and mamma would tell you, that I
am too fond of romping still.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” Lewis said:
he was very glad Helen did not
love playing with dolls, except it was
the sport of giving them a sail in the
brook, which ran at the end of his
uncle’s garden.</p>

<p>Helen had no brothers and sisters
of her own; but she had spent many
happy hours with her cousins, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
they were visiting at her papa’s
house.</p>

<p>“We have no garden for you
here,” said Edward; “but we have
a great many things to show you;
and I think you will not soon grow
tired of the beach, and the Esplanade,
and the chain-pier.”</p>

<p>“Nor of looking at the sea either,”
added Lewis; “for I think, Helen,
you have done scarcely any thing
else since you have been here.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen it before, you
know,” said Helen, again turning her
eyes towards the blue expanse of
waters, as though she thought she
had assigned a very sufficient reason
for the silence, which she was not
usually remarkable for.</p>

<p>“Lewis, my dear,” said Mrs. Ashton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
“set a chair for your cousin;
we will take our tea now. I am sure
the travellers will be glad of it: and
if Helen is not too much fatigued for
walking this evening, we will go with
her to the beach, that she may have
a nearer view of that which seems to
interest her so much.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you! I am not
much tired, I assure you; I shall be
quite rested when we have finished
tea.”</p>

<p>Tea was soon dispatched; and the
children were ready to accompany
Mr. and Mrs. Ashton.</p>

<p>The evening was particularly fine;
and Helen admired all that she saw,
quite as much as her cousins had
wished or expected.</p>

<p>There were gay parties in plenty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
riding or walking along the cliff,
and the waves sparkled as brightly
as ever in the sun-beams; but Edward
and Lewis had walked this way
so often before, that this evening
they wished to change their route.</p>

<p>Their mother and Helen good-naturedly
gave up their desire to
remain longer on the beach; and
Mr. Ashton inquired which way his
boys wished them go.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” said Edward, “Lewis
and I want very much to see Nicholas
Tattersal’s tomb; mamma said we
should find it near the entrance to
the old church: she told us the history
of Tattersal’s bravely assisting
the unfortunate King Charles II. to
escape from his rebellious subjects,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
and that has made us wish to see the
spot where he was buried.”</p>

<p>On their way to the church-yard,
Helen begged Lewis to tell her all he
knew about Charles’s escape, and the
generous behaviour of his conductor;
so that by the time they reached the
spot, she was as much interested as
her cousins in the object of their
search.</p>

<p>It was found to be a slab of black
marble, on which was carved the
following inscription, and under it
some uncouth rhymes, which Edward
with difficulty deciphered:—</p>


<div class="blockquot">

loyalty, Charles II., King of England,
after he had escaped the swords
of his merciless rebels, and his forces
received a fatal overthrow at Worcester,
September 3rd, 1651, was
faithfully preserved and conveyed
to France, departed this life 26th of
July, 1674.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Edward looked up from the
monument, and was going to ask,
whether the eight princes here spoken
of were Charles’s foreign allies, he
saw that his auditors had left him.</p>

<p>His mother was sitting on some
ruined steps, which led to the remains
of an ancient cross, enjoying
the wide-extended view which the
church-yard commanded; and Lewis
and Helen were together, conning an
epitaph on a tomb-stone at a little
distance.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Helen beckoned,
and called to Edward to come and
hear a very wonderful history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>The whole party were soon gathered
round the stone, by which Helen
was standing: on it was engraven a
short account of a remarkable person,
named Phœbe Hessel. It relates
that she was born at Stepney,
in the year 1713, and served for
many years as a private soldier in
the fifth regiment of foot, in different
parts of Europe. In 1745, she fought
under the command of the Duke of
Cumberland, at Fontenoy, where she
received a bayonet wound in her arm.
Her long life, which commenced in
Queen Ann’s reign, extended to
that of George the Fourth; from
whose bounty she received comfort
and support in her latter years. She
died at Brighton, where she had long
resided, December 12, 1821, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
advanced age of one hundred and
eight years.</p>

<p>“Dear uncle,” said Helen, “what
an extraordinary character! I do not
think I could have loved a woman
who had been thus employed in the
destruction of her fellow-creatures.
The epitaph does not tell us that she
had any particular object in view in
entering the army; such as seeking
shelter and disguise for a time; or,
that she did it from a sense of duty,
like Joan of Arc.”</p>

<p>“Whatever were the motives to
such a line of conduct, my love,” replied
her uncle, “it is indeed to be
lamented, that one, who doubtless
possessed strength of mind in no
common degree, should be so misguided
as thus to misapply her time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
and talents, which might have been
rendered eminently useful, if dedicated
to His service, who is emphatically
styled ‘The Prince of Peace.’
But let us hope, that in the latter
years of her lengthened existence
she was permitted to see the error of
her ways, and to enlist under His
banner; becoming a Christian, not
merely in name, but in practice
also.”</p>

<p>The children listened attentively
to Mr. Ashton’s remarks; and he
took the opportunity of pointing out
to them how instructive a lesson the
prospect of so many silent abodes of
the dead may afford.</p>

<p>“See, my children,” he said, “what
becomes of all the wisdom, riches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
and beauty of man, when his crumbling
ashes unite with their parent
dust, and all distinctions of rank
and excellence are lost in that one
common lot—the grave. Oh! then,
may we never live as though this
world were our home, instead of
what it is designed to be, a preparation
for a better, a more enduring
inheritance!”</p>

<p>“Look, dear mamma,” said Edward,
“there is the new-made grave
of a little child.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my love,” said Mrs. Ashton,
“I believe I need not tell you
what that should teach us.”</p>

<p>Edward pressed his mother’s hand,
in token of assent.</p>

<p>“Aunt,” said Helen, “I learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
some pretty lines of poetry, the
other day, which were inscribed on
an infant’s tomb.”</p>

<p>“Will you repeat them, my love?”
asked Mrs. Ashton.</p>

<p>Helen did so.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Well, my little girl,” said Mr.
Ashton to Helen, one morning, when
the breakfast-things had been removed,
“I suppose by this time
Edward and Lewis have shown you all
that is worth seeing in this gay place,
and have made you nearly as wise as
themselves. I am quite at leisure
this morning; but I am afraid there
is nothing left for me to do as a chaperon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear uncle,” said
Helen, laughing; “you could do a
great deal for us, I assure you; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
only see how very fast it is raining!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lewis, in a disconsolate
tone, “there will be no going
out to-day; the clouds are coming
up thicker and faster.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are mistaken there,
my boy: even your weather-oracle,
Tom Price, tells me, he thinks it will
be fine; but if it should prove that
he is mistaken for once, we will try
to make ourselves happy within
doors, and not waste our time in
unavailing regrets. The rain is much
needed, and the country will look
more beautiful after it.”</p>

<p>“Do you not think, papa,” asked
Lewis, who was not at all disposed
to look on the bright side of the picture
this morning, “that it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
be much pleasanter if the weather
were always bright and calm. I am
sure, if rain and storms are useful,
they do a good deal of mischief sometimes,
and often disappoint us of
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Why, Lewis,” said his father,
smiling, “one would think you had
been studying some of the ancient
poets, who wrote so much in praise
of such a state as you have been supposing.
But really, I cannot say
I agree with you, in thinking that it
would at all add to our comfort, constituted
as we are, to be exempted
from changes of weather and climate;
even imagining that such a thing were
possible. It is true, there is much
enjoyment in the peace and quiet of
a tranquil summer’s day, when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
can leave the busy haunts of men for
some secluded glen or mountain-path,
while the sky above is blue
and cloudless, and the broad sea
looks still and beautiful. It is delightful
then to listen to the sweet
notes of the birds, and the low murmuring
of the breeze; or even to
watch the insects that sport in the
sun-beams, as if they too rejoiced in
their existence. But, do you think
we should enjoy these pleasures, or
prize them as we ought to do, if no
changes in the elements disturbed
the unvarying calmness of the scene?
No doubt we should soon become listless
and weary, tired of the sameness
that reigned around, and longing
for the hopes and fears that are
now our motives to exertion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
add interest to labour. Even the sea
which you have often looked at with
so much delight, would cease to
charm, if its aspect were always the
same. And in all the works of the
beneficent Creator we may observe,
that with perfect beauty, endless variety
and change are combined.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton could not tell whether
his little boy was convinced of the
truth of his remarks, for Lewis was
very busily employed in twirling the
tassel of the window-blind, as though
his whole thoughts were engrossed in
the employ. Helen sat down to her
needle, and her uncle took up the
newspaper, and began to read. Helen
saw that Lewis was sorry for this;
and she asked her uncle if he were
reading any thing very interesting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
“No, my love,” replied he; “I
hope you will not interrupt me by
speaking or asking questions.”</p>

<p>Lewis gave his cousin a look, which
plainly said, thank you, Helen; and
going up to his father, he exclaimed,
“Dear papa! I am convinced that I
was wrong—very wrong. I might
have known that I should have been
one of the first to complain, if things
were as I seemed to wish them to be:
and, papa, you need not tell me of
how much use the rain is to us, and
the wind too, which sends vessels
from one port to another, and turns
the sails of mills, and does a great
deal more beside, I dare say. But
now, papa, if you really do not want
to read, may I ask you what it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
that occasioned the thick mist, which
seemed to hang over the sea last
night, when mamma told us it was
not fit for us to go out.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton was pleased with
Lewis’s frank confession of his fault;
but he did not praise his little boy
for doing his duty; he knew that the
feeling of satisfaction that attended it,
would be a sufficient reward.</p>

<p>Laying down the paper, and shaking
him kindly by the hand, he said,
“Tell me, Lewis, what do you imagine
water to be?”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Lewis, “it is a
simple fluid. I mean, papa, that it
is not composed of several ingredients;
unless it be the water of the
ocean, which you know is very salt;
and sometimes part of the soil through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
which water runs, mixes with it and
changes its colour.”</p>

<p>“Many substances,” said his father,
“were once thought to be simple,
which the knowledge of chemistry
has since taught us are formed by
the union of other bodies, very opposite
in their natures—water is one of
these: you will understand more of
its properties, I hope, when we have
time to study chemistry together.
But now I will only tell you, that
water is composed of two airs or
gases; one of them is lighter than
any substance we are acquainted
with; it is very inflammable, and
burns when flame is applied to it;
the other is that part of the atmosphere
which is absolutely necessary
to the existence of living creatures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
whether in air or water. These two
gases form water, by combustion.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful!” exclaimed
Lewis, “for water, you know, papa,
extinguishes fire.”</p>

<p>“It is, indeed, astonishing, Lewis:
there is no end to the wonders which
the knowledge of chemistry reveals,
and no doubt will continue to reveal
to us. But, now tell me, Lewis,
have you ever seen water in any
other than a fluid state?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, papa, frozen water is
quite solid; it then becomes ice.”</p>

<p>“And,” interrupted Helen, “heated
water becomes steam or vapour;
though I recollect mamma’s telling
me, that it was a fluid still; and that
even the air which surrounds us is
a fluid, like water, only much less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
dense; for when I moved her fan
backwards and forwards, I could feel
the resistance of the air very plainly.”</p>

<p>“Well done, my little philosopher!”
exclaimed Mr. Ashton. “Lewis, I
dare say you have not forgotten all
this.”</p>

<p>“Oh! no papa,” said Lewis, “I
often wish those days would come
again, when Edward and I were
always at home with you, and
when we used to try experiments
together.”</p>

<p>“Well, Lewis, such days may
come again,” said his father; “but,
now let us attend to the present subject.
To make it clearer to you, I
must ask you one more question
about our experiments:—do you recollect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
what took place when I held
a cold plate, for some time, over the
boiling water in the tea-urn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, papa,” answered Lewis, “the
steam which rose from the urn was
condensed; for, as you said, the particles,
which had separated, again
united as soon as they came in contact
with the cold plate, and ran off
in little streams of water.”</p>

<p>“And what caused the separation
of the particles of water?” inquired
his father.</p>

<p>“Heat,” said Lewis, “and cold,
which you told us means only the
absence of heat, caused them to unite
again.”</p>

<p>“Ah! now, papa, I think I understand
what you mean. Yesterday
the weather was very hot; and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
suppose the mist which we noticed
was produced in the same manner as
steam is; only that it is the <em>sun’s</em>
heat which turns the particles of
water into vapour. But, papa, what
becomes of it all then? for if this
watery vapour is lighter than the air,
it would continue to rise till it had
quite disappeared.”</p>

<p>“When the string of your kite
broke, Lewis, and it soared far away,
for a short time, higher than it had
ever been before, what do you suppose
occasioned it to fall again?”</p>

<p>Lewis thought for a moment, and
then said, “Partly because I had no
string to guide it, and partly, I suppose,
papa, because the air above
might be lighter, and not able to
support its weight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said his papa, “the atmosphere
becomes less dense as it is more
distant from the earth; so that the
vapour, which the sun causes to exhale,
rises until it reaches a region of
its own weight; here it remains stationary
for a time, till the accumulation
of fresh vapours forms clouds,
and these at length becoming too
heavy for the air to support, descend
in copious showers of rain, to refresh
and fertilize the earth.”</p>

<p>Lewis thought he could quite understand
this. “But is this wonderful
process,” he asked, “always
going on? for, if so much rain and
moisture falls upon the earth and
sinks into it, does it not injure it?
I should think the sun and wind
would only dry the surface.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a spring?”
asked Lewis’s father.</p>

<p>Lewis said, he had seen several:
there was the spring in the hill-side,
which supplied the brook that ran at
the bottom of his uncle’s garden; and
the chalybeate-spring; and his papa
had once shown them how the men,
who were digging in a gravel-pit
were troubled with the little springs,
which kept rising out of the earth.
They were obliged to work night and
day, to pump the water out into
slanting wooden troughs, by which
means it was carried down to the
river.</p>

<p>“And the brook at the bottom of
the garden,” said Helen, “runs into
the same river. I have often watched
it, winding through the green meadows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
till it joined the broad stream
of the Lea.”</p>

<p>“But, Helen,” asked Mr. Ashton,
“is this little stream always flowing?”</p>

<p>“I do remember once,” Helen said,
when she had thought a little while,
“that the brook was quite dry: we
had had no rain for many weeks; the
grass was dry and brown; and old
Godfrey had to drive the cows a long
way to the river-side, to let them
drink. At last, there was a storm of
thunder and lightning, and the rain
came down in torrents. I recollect
saying to papa, if I were Godfrey, I
would put out some tubs to-night to
catch the rain, that I might not have
such a long journey to take to-morrow;
but papa told me, there would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
be water again in the brook very
soon, he had no doubt. Well, it
did nothing but rain for several days,
till I was tired of the sight of clouds.
At last they cleared away; and as
soon as the grass was dry, I ran
down to my favourite seat by the
brook, which was bubbling on just
as it always used to do.”</p>

<p>“Then, papa,” said Lewis, “the
water which sinks into the ground
rises out of it again in springs, I
suppose; and springs supply rivers,
and rivers flow on till they reach the
sea. Can it really be the same water
that comes back to the ocean again,
after forming in turn clouds, rain,
springs, and rivers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lewis,” said his father,
“this is indeed the case; and if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
will take the trouble to follow it
through all these various and wonderful
changes, you will not fear the
earth’s becoming saturated by the
quantity of water that falls upon it;
but you will clearly perceive, that it
does not contain more water now
than it did at the time of the creation.
There is much more connected
with the subject of water, which you
may at some other time be interested
in thinking about. But now run for
your domino-box, and I will have a
game with you and Helen; I was
busy when you asked me to play last
night.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, papa,” said Lewis,
“shall I call Edward?”</p>

<p>“No, do not call him; I dare
say he is very happy; he is helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
mamma. We will have one game,
and then Helen may put on her
things, and you shall go with me to
the National Schools.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Now, Helen,” said Lewis, as they
drew near the building appropriated
to the schools, “you will see Tom
Price. I wish you had been with us
when we went to see his mother, and
grandfather, and little brother;” and
Lewis was going on to tell Helen of
the presents they had made, but he
recollected that this would be too
much like display: his embarrassment,
however, was soon relieved,
by Helen’s asking, why her uncle
called Price, Lewis’s oracle?</p>

<p>“Because I always consult him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
about the weather; and you see he
was right this morning: he knows a
great deal about it, as most people do
who have to get their living in the
open air. He is a fisherman now;
for he is too old and infirm to make
long voyages, though he was a brave
sailor once, and has been out in many
a terrible storm. His poor son was
lost at sea, and now he takes care of
the widow and her two little children:
but here we are at the school.”</p>

<p>Lewis and Helen followed Mr.
Ashton into a large room, in which
many boys were occupied: they were
seated in rows, one behind the other,
and were employed in writing on
slates the words which the monitors,
from time to time, dictated.</p>

<p>Lewis’s father had brought some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
books for the use of the institution;
and while he was engaged in speaking
to the master, the children watched
with surprise, the uniform, regular
movement of so many hands,
when the head monitor told them to
turn, show, or clean their slates.</p>

<p>Lewis was afraid of interrupting
the order, by asking for his little
friend; but he gave him a nod of approbation
as he passed him on their
way out.</p>

<p>“We will just go through the
girls’ school-room,” said Mr. Ashton,
“which is of the same dimensions as
the boys’.—I am sorry we cannot now
stay to see the mode of instructing
the children: every thing appears to
be in excellent order.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the master, bowing
to his visitor, “system, is every
thing in a large school, such as
this.”</p>

<p>“Very true, my good friend,” returned
Mr. Ashton, smiling good-humouredly;
“only we must remember,
that children are not mere machines;
and that the education we
give them should be such as to render
them intelligent and useful members
of society.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">When the little party reached home,
they found Mrs. Ashton and Edward
waiting to receive them. The sun
was shining brightly; and, indeed,
all appearance of rain had vanished,
and an open carriage was at the
door.</p>

<p>The children’s eyes sparkled with
delight as the driver assisted them to
get into it; then came a large basket,
which must be accommodated with a
place; papa’s telescope, mamma’s
travelling-cloak, more clothing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the children, and lastly, papa and
mamma themselves.</p>

<p>“Now we are off!” cried Lewis.
“Papa, have you told the man which
way we are to go?”</p>

<p>His father nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Edward,” said Helen, “you look
very knowing; I do believe you are
in the secret.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it is no secret now,” Edward
said: “we are on the road to
the Dyke, and I have been helping
mamma this morning to prepare for
the trip; only I would not talk about
it, for fear the weather should disappoint
you.”</p>

<p>“I will try to bear disappointments
better,” said Lewis, who had not forgotten
the incident of the morning;
“and then papa and mamma will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
be afraid of letting me know their
plans.”</p>

<p>“Well,” interrupted Helen, “I
must say I like excursions better when
they are quite unexpected, as this
was.”</p>

<p>“So do not I,” said Edward, “there
is a great deal of enjoyment in thinking
of, and preparing for, them beforehand.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said his father, “it seems
you and Helen are both satisfied; but
there is one pleasure still which may
belong to us all; and you seem quite
to have forgotten it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! papa,” cried Lewis, “you
mean the pleasure of retrospection:
every one likes the pleasures of retrospection.”</p>

<p>“Then, my boy,” said his father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
“it should be our constant desire, so
to pass each day and hour as that
the retrospect may, at least, give us
no cause for pain.”</p>

<p>“I think we shall all be very happy
to-day; do not you, dear aunt?” asked
Helen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton smiled as she repeated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say, is this a time to be gloomy and sad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When all nature is smiling around;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When even the deep blue heavens look glad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And joy springs from the blossoming ground?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“This may well be called ‘blossoming
ground,’” said Helen. “Look, aunt,
there is my favourite little ivy-leaved
campanula, and the star-thistle in
abundance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her aunt, “and if I
mistake not, you will find on the
hill-side, near the Dyke, the musk-ophrys,
which you were wishing for,
to put in your herbal, and some species
of orchis.”</p>

<p>“Helen,” said Lewis, “if you care
so much for such common weeds as
these, I wonder what you would say
to the plant captain Manning told
us about the other day, with blossoms
as large as—let me see—as
large round as the flower-bed before
your parlour-window: you would be
puzzled to get an herbal huge enough
for such a giant-specimen.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Helen, good-humouredly,
“I should say that you
and captain Manning were laughing
at me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Well, then, if you are so unbelieving,”
replied Lewis, “ask papa;
I suppose you can trust him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton happened to have in
his pocket, the number of the Penny
Magazine which contained an account
of this curious plant; and he
read it to the wondering Helen:—</p>

<p>“In 1818, Doctor Arnold discovered,
in the island of Sumatra, a
flower which he named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rafflesia
Arnoldi</i>; and which an author has
called with much justice, ‘the magnificent
Titan of the vegetable kingdom.’
The human mind, indeed, had
never conceived such a flower: the
circumference of the full-expanded
flower is nine feet, its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nectarium</i> is
calculated to hold nine pints, the pistils
are as large as cows’-horns, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the entire weight of the flower is calculated
to be fifteen pounds.”</p>

<p>“Look, look, Helen!” exclaimed
Edward, as soon as his father had
ceased to read, “there must be a
rabbit-warren near. There they go;
two, three, four rabbits; and there
are two men with guns on their
shoulders coming up the side of the
hill. Papa, I do wonder any one
can like to make such a disturbance
among the poor little creatures, just
for their own amusement: it would
be much more diverting to me, I am
sure, to see them gambol and frolic
over these green hillocks. Ah, there
are their pretty young ones, running
as fast as their little legs will carry
them, by the side of their mother.”</p>

<p>“Run, run, little ones!” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Helen, forgetting the wonderful flower,
in her anxiety for the rabbits. “Now
they have popped into a hole; but,
oh! I am afraid it is of no use, for
those sportsmen have a dog with
them, and they will be sure to catch
some of the innocent creatures.”</p>

<p>“Helen,” asked Lewis, archly, “do
you never eat rabbit-pie when it comes
to table?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” said Helen, “I do,
it is true; but, Lewis, I would rather
not think about that now; and if the
poor animals must be killed for our
food, I am sure it might be done in
a more humane manner than hunting
them with dogs and guns.”</p>

<p>Lewis could not deny this.</p>

<p>“Papa,” said Helen, “once allowed
me to keep rabbits, but you may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
sure I never had any of my pets
killed. It was such pleasure to
watch the pretty creatures, and feed
them every day; and then you cannot
think how busy the old doe was
in making a nest for her little ones.
She chose the softest hay she could
find, and when she had munched out
all the hard parts, she stripped some
of the thick warm down from her own
breast to spread over it. At first,
she covered up her young ones so
closely that I could not see them;
and papa told me not to disturb the
nest: indeed, I should have been
quite afraid to do so, for Minny,
who was so gentle in common, used
to try to bite me whenever I went
near the nest, until her little ones
grew larger and stronger and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
she would let me take them in my
hand and feed them.”</p>

<p>“This is the case with many animals,
my dear Helen,” said her aunt;
“indeed, the attachment which some
creatures manifest to their young is
so strong, that they will die rather
than abandon them. I recollect once
reading an anecdote respecting an
American sow, which pleased me
much; because in her care for her
offspring she evinced a degree of sagacity,
which we are apt not to give
the species credit for possessing. This
animal was accustomed to pass her
days in the woods, with a numerous
litter of pigs, but to return regularly
to the house in the evening, to share
with her family a substantial supper.
One of her pigs was, however, quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
slipped away to be roasted; in a day
or two afterwards, another; and then
a third. It would appear that this
careful mother knew the number of
her offspring, and missed those that
were taken from her; for after this
she came alone to her evening meal.
This occurring repeatedly, she was
watched coming out of the wood, and
observed to drive back her pigs from
its extremity; grunting with so much
earnestness, and in a manner so intelligible,
that they retired at her
command, and waited patiently for
her return.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The children were much amused
with this anecdote.</p>

<p>Edward asked Helen, what became
of her rabbits at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Helen said, “that when she went
to school, her little pets were all
given to farmer Johnstone’s daughter,
Susan. Minny and Bob were still
alive and well, and the little ones
they had nursed so tenderly were
grown as large as themselves.”</p>

<p>And now Mr. Ashton told the little
party, they must leave the carriage,
and ascend the lofty rampart
which they saw before them; and
which, he said, was reported to have
been formerly used as a place of security
for the distressed Britons, when
invaded by their powerful foes, the
Romans; being still known by the
designation of the Poor-man’s-wall.
The intrenchment, which is accessible
only by a narrow projection to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
the south, is surrounded by a broad
ditch.</p>

<p>Having reached the summit of the
mount, the lovely and extensive prospect
which opened to the view, was
an ample compensation for the fatigue
of ascending. The undulating verdant
downs, the boundless ocean, and
the distant view of hill, and dale, and
wood, altogether formed a prospect
more picturesque and beautiful than
the children had ever beheld.</p>

<p>The day was clear; and papa’s
telescope was in great request.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton pointed out the romantic
view of the extensive weald of
Sussex, and parts of Hampshire,
Surrey, and Kent adjoining.</p>

<p>At last, when the scenery, far and
near, had been admired again and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
again, when the boys had made the
tour of the Dyke as often as they
pleased, and Helen had filled her
handkerchief with the musk-ophrys,
and other wild-flowers, the happy
party left the attractive spot, and
were soon reseated in the carriage.</p>

<p>“Not homeward-bound yet, papa!”
exclaimed Lewis.</p>

<p>“I thought,” returned his father,
“you would not object, now that we
are so near, to see the little village of
Poynings; particularly as there are
some remains of antiquity in the
neighbourhood, which, perhaps, may
interest you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! thank you!” exclaimed
the children, one and all.</p>

<p>The name of the village of Poynings,
is derived from two ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
British words, descriptive of its situation;
<em>pou</em>, country, and <em>ings</em>,
downs: that is, the plain country
under the Downs. The church is a
large and ancient edifice; it is built
in the form of a cross, with a tower
in the centre. The ruins Mr. Ashton
spoke of, were those of some
stupendous building raised in ancient
times, which tradition relates was
the seat of the barons of Poynings.</p>

<p>On their return, Mr. Ashton pointed
out to his companions, the ruins
of an encampment, called Hollingbury
Castle, or Hill.</p>

<p>“The rampart,” he said, “which
was once strong and high, is now
much dilapidated, Three tumuli have
lately been discovered, containing
some Roman coins; they were probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
raised over the bodies of some
who fell in battle. How different a
scene these peaceful Downs now present:
on this very spot where, perhaps,
once resounded the din of war,
nothing but the pleasant tinkling of
the sheep-bell, or the lark’s shrill
notes of joy, reach the ear. The
bodies of thousands of human beings,
who fell victims to avarice, ambition,
or revenge, then strewed the plain,
where now the solitary herd-boy
tends the flock; while beneath us,
on the dark blue ocean, which once
bore to our devoted land the hostile
fleets of an invading foe, we may
mark the sails of distant vessels,
laden with the blessings of commerce,
the fruits of industry and peace.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
My children, how thankful we should
be, that our lot has been cast in such
favoured times; and, whilst permitted
to enjoy these gifts, let us never forget
the debt of gratitude we owe to
the bounteous Giver.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">“Dear papa,” said Lewis, as he
took leave of his father and mother,
before retiring to rest, after their
pleasant journey, “I have been
very happy to-day. I am glad now
that it rained this morning, because
I learned a great many things from
you about rain, which I did not know
before; and we should not have enjoyed
our ride so much, I am sure,
if the roads had been as dusty as
they were yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Good night to you all,” said Edward.
“I am sure Helen, and Lewis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
and I shall think very often of our
visit to Brighton; and, particularly
of our journey to-day; and we shall
have pleasure in thinking about it,
perhaps, when we are far away from
one another. Papa, we have only
one more day to spend together.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said his father, taking
his little boy’s hand, “I need not
tell you how much pleasure it gives
us, to see you all so happy. But, I
hope, my dear children, that your
having been unusually entertained
and interested, will not make your
useful and necessary employments
at school seem dull or irksome to
you.”</p>

<p>“Dear uncle,” said Helen, “I
do believe you are thinking of Mrs.
Edgeworth’s Rosamond; for she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
disposed, just as you said, to be idle
and uncomfortable after her visit to
Mrs. Egerton’s, and the old castle:
but I will try and imitate her, and
not give way to an inclination to idleness;
for you know, Rosamond’s mother
told her, it was natural for her
and every human being to feel weary
after unusual excitement; but that
the fault consisted in not trying to
conquer her feelings.”</p>

<p>“I was not thinking of Rosamond,
my little girl,” said her uncle, stooping
to kiss her; “but I am glad that
you remember and apply so well
what you have read. And now go
and rest your weary head on the
pillow, and sleep sweetly till morning;
for we have a long journey, you
know, in prospect for to-morrow; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
when we arrive at home, we may
there talk over the many pleasant
scenes we have viewed, and reflect
upon the wisdom of the Creator,
whose power and beneficence are
so wonderfully displayed in all his
works.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
